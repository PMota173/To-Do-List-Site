# To-Do List App

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a simple To-Do List web application. The application allows users to add, check, and remove tasks from their to-do list.

## Features

- Add Task: Users can input tasks into the provided text box and click the "Add" button to add them to the to-do list.

- Check/Uncheck Task: By clicking on a task in the list, users can toggle between checked and unchecked states. Checked tasks are visually indicated with a strikethrough, and the checkbox icon changes accordingly.

- Remove Task: Users can remove a task by clicking the "x" button next to it.

- Persistent Storage: The to-do list data is stored locally using localStorage, allowing the user's tasks to persist across sessions.
